- Install Python 3.11.3 (if you don't already have it)

- In order to run the python files, make sure to have all the listed modules installed:


pip install vision
pip install transformers
pip install torch
pip install sklearn
pip install runModel
pip install requests


- To get the ml model working:
1. Go to the file ml/path_to_save_model/linkToCustomConfig.txt and follow the instructions there
2. Go to this file: post_processing/runModel.py
3. Go to line 13 and replace fine_tuned_model_path = "ml/path_to_save_model (too big)" with fine_tuned_model_path = "ml/path_to_save_model"

- To get this program to fully work, you'll need Google Cloud (for mac only, if you need help with windows, pls leave a comment)
1. Search up Google Cloud and sign up for a new account (you should get $300 credit)
2. Once setting up a new account, make a new project
3. Search of Vision AI and add the API to your project
3. Once you do that, honestly, follow the tutorial on there (there are a ton of different parts, like installing google cloud, testing out with demo images, etc. that make it just a bit too long to put here (and I am also writing this at 4:34 am ðŸ« )).

- If you would like to re-train the model:
1. Go to this file: ml/modelTraining/training.py
2. Go to line 12 and change save_path = "ml/path_to_save_model (too big)" 12 to save_path = "ml/path_to_save_model"
3. Go to this file: ml/very large datasets/linkToLargeDataset.txt
4. Follow the instructions there.

- For more info on training your own models and making your own datasets, I suggest you go to these websites (I used these and they were quite helpful)
1. https://huggingface.co/kornosk/polibertweet-political-twitter-roberta-mlm (our model is taken from here)
2. https://huggingface.co/blog/sentiment-analysis-twitter (how I kind of figured out how to use the model to do other things)
3. https://www.kaggle.com (where to get some pre-made datasets from)
