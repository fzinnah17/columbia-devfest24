Although there has been a revolution in information technology since the first news reports were carried over telegraph lines in 1917, The Canadian Press exists and performs its duties today for the same reason.

Our web-based journalism platform is based on the belief that a high-level, non-political, solution-based conversation that includes the private sector is a critical part of finding solutions to the issues we now face.
